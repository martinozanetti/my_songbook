[Verse 1]
    D     G                          C     G
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
C       G   D                     G D     G
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
    D       G                  C       G    C  G
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
D                          G    D   G
Knockin' me out with those American thighs
 
D      G                        C           G     C
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
G   D                          G    D       G
She told me to come, but I was already there
 D         G                        C     G   C
'Cause the walls start shaking, the earth was quaking
G  D                    D
My mind was aching, and we were making it
 
[Chorus]
    G            Cadd9 G/B   D      Cadd9  G/B
And you shook me all   night long

        G                  C    G        C
Working double time on the seduction line
G       D                        G      D   G
She was one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine
D      G                 C     G      C
Wanted no applause, just another course
G    D                G          D      G
Made a meal out of me and come back for more
 
D      G                    C  G       C
Had to cool me down to take another round
G   D                            G  D       G
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
 D         G                       C     G   C
'Cause the walls were shaking, the earth was quaking
G  D                    D
My mind was aching, and we were making it
