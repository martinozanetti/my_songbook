E         Bm         F#m                 C#m
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins 
F#m                  A
Silently closing her bedroom door
F#m                       A
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
 
         E   Bm            F#m                 C#m
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching a handkerchief
F#m                 A
Quietly turning the backdoor key
F#m                     A
Stepping outside she is free
 
 
[Chorus]
E
She (we gave her most of our lives)
E
Is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives)
E                  E7         E           C#m
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
C#m                       F#m                 C#m
She is leaving home after living alone for so many years
 
E      Bm            F#m                C#m
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown,
F#m                        A
Picks up the letter that's lying there.
F#m                   A
Standing alone at the top of the stairs,
 
           E        Bm           F#m                C#m
She breaks down and cries to her husband Daddy our baby's gone.
F#m                       A
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
F#m                      A
How could she do this to me?
 
 
[Chorus 2]
E
She (we never thought of ourselves)
E
Is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)
E                  E7           E            C#m
Home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)
C#m                      F#m                 C#m
She's leaving home after living alone for so many years
 
E      Bm         F#m                 C#m
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
F#m                  A
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
F#m       A6           A
Meeting a man from the motor trade
 
 
[Chorus 3]
E
She (what did we do that was wrong?)
E
Is having - we didn't know it was wrong
E               E7             E           C#m
Fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
C#m                       F#m                  C#m      F#m
Something inside that was always denied for so many years
 
C#m           F#m        A    E
She's leaving home, bye bye
