I'm the kind of guy,

Who never used to cry,

Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one.
 
Send her back to me,
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery
 
I'll remember all the little things we've done.
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one, lonely one.
 
Send her back to me,
'Cause everyone can see,        Am
Without her I will be in misery (oh oh oh)
     C    Am
In misery (oh  oh oh)
       C
misery
