I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink, I'm so tired,
   D6             E7
My mind is on the blink.
  A               E+         F#m          Dm
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink. No, no, no.

I'm so tired, I don't know what to do, I'm so tired,

My mind is set on you.
  A               E+              F#m                 Dm
I wonder should I call you, but I know what you would do.

I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset. Although I'm so tired,
D6                E7
I'll have another cigarette.
