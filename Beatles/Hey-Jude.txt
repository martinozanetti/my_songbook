    D                   A
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
       A7  A7sus4   A7      D
Take a sad song and make it better
  G                           D
Remember to let her into your heart
                 A                D
and then you can start to make it better
 
[Verse 2]
    D               A
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
         A7   A7sus4 A7          D
You were made to  go out and get her
    G                             D
The minute you let her under your skin
           A              |D - |Dmaj7 - |D7 - |
then you begin to make it better
 
[Chorus]
                         G        G/F#    Em
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
      G        A/C#   A        D         Dmaj7 D7
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
                              G       G/F#     Em
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
   G          A/C#    A      D
by making his world a little colder
