I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.
E                                      Dadd9  A   E
She showed me her room, isn't it good, Norweg-ian wood.
 
    Em                                         A
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere.
   Em                                           F#m7     B
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.
 
E                               Dadd9    A   E
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
E                                       Dadd9     A   E
We talked until two and then she said, "It's time for bed."

    Em                                               A
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
  Em                                                F#m7     B
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath.
 
E                              Dadd9     A   E
And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown.
E                               Dadd9  A   E
So I lit a fire, isn't it good, Norweg-ian wood.
