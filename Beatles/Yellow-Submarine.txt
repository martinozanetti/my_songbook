 C       D        C      G
In the town where I was born,
 Em     Am       C         D
Lived a man who sailed to sea.
 C      D      C       G
And he told us of his life,
Em      Am      C    D
In the land of submarines.
 
 C      D      C       G
So we sailed unto the sun,
 Em      Am        C       D
Till we found the sea of green.
 C       D      C          G
And we lived beneath the waves,
Em      Am      C    D
In our yellow submarine.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                  D
We all live in a yellow submarine,
                    G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
G                  D
We all live in a yellow submarine,
                    G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

 C         D         C     G
And our friends are all aboard,
 Em   Am           C         D
Many more of them live next door.
 C       D      C       G
And the band begins to play.
 
G   D
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                  D
We all live in a yellow submarine,
                    G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
G                  D
We all live in a yellow submarine,
                    G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

 C     D      C      G
 Em   Am      C      D

 Em   Am      C      D
 
 
[Verse]
 
 C     D      C       G
As we live a life of ease,
Em   Am             C      D
Everyone of us has all we need.
 C       D       C       G
Sky of blue and sea of green,
Em     Am      C    D
In our yellow submarine.

We all live in a yellow submarine,
                    G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
G                  D
We all live in a yellow submarine,
                    G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
 
G                  D
We all live in a yellow submarine,
                    G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
G                  D
We all live in a yellow submarine,
                    G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
