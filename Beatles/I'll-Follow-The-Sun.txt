 A        G7          D            E7
    One day, you'll look, to see I've gone
          D          Bm    E7       A7         D
    For tomorrow may rain, so, I'll follow the sun
 
    A         G7          D          E7
    Some day, you'll know, I was the one
          D          Bm     E7      A7         D
    But tomorrow may rain, so, I'll follow the sun
 
  D  D7         G7                 Gm                D
 -->And now the time has come, and so my love I must go
  D7             G7             Gm                  D
    And though I lose a friend, in the end you will know,
    Em7
    Oh....oh.....
 
    A        G7           D           E7
    One day, you'll find, that I have gone
          D          Bm     E7     A7         D
    But tomorrow may rain so, I'll follow the sun
