I've just seen a face, I can't forget the time or place where we just met.
                                                                 D
She's just the girl for me and I want all the world to see we've met.

I have never known the likes of this, I've been alone and I have missed,
                                                                    D
Things and kept out of sight, for other girls were never quite like this.
