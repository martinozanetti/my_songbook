  C
I listen for your footsteps, coming up the drive.
F
Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive.
G
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door.
        F                                           C
I don't hear it, does it mean you don't love me any more?
 
  C
I hear the clock a'ticking, on the mantel shelf.
F
See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself.
  G
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself.
        F                                           C
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me any more?
 
              C
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue.
                F
'Cause you know darling, I love only you.
             C
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go.
              G                            F                   C
Don't pass me by,            don't make me cry.
 
    C
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair.
F
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair.
    G
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two.
       F                                                            C
I said that's all right I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you.
 
              C
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue.
                F
'Cause you know darling, I love only you.
