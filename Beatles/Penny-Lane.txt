In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs,
         B                                  Bm7
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known.
            Bm6                  Gmaj7        F#7
And all the people that come and go, stop and say “Hello”.
 
       B                         C#m7     F#7
On the corner is a banker with a motor car.
           B                                Bm7
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
        Bm6                  Gmaj7       F#7
And the banker never wears a mac, in the pouring rain.

Very strange.   Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A                               D                F#7  C#m7  F#7 nc
There beneath the blue suburban skies, I sit and mean-while back,
 
         B                               C#m7      F#7
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour-glass.
           B                           Bm7
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.
            Bm6                  Gmaj7         F#7
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine.

A four of fish and finger pies in summer. Mean-while back,
 
           B                            C#m7      F#7
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout,
           B                               Bm7
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
               Bm6                    Gmaj7        F#7
And though she feels as if she’s in a play, she is anyway.
 
         B                              C#m7    F#7
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer.
           B                            Bm7
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
             Bm6            Gmaj7       F#7
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain.
