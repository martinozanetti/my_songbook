E              B          F#m
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
          B                        E
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
E            B             F#m
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
         B                      E
And I'll try not to sing out of key.

E        B           F#m
How do I feel by the end of the day
