 
[VERSE]
C                C/B
 Your day breaks, your mind aches
Am             C/G              Fmaj7             Bb
 You find that all the words of kindness linger on
            C
When she no longer needs you
 
 
[VERSE]
C             C/B
 She wakes up, she makes up
Am             C/G              Fmaj7             Bb
 She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
       C
She no longer needs you
 
 
[CHORUS]
           Dm           A7
And in her eyes you see nothing
Dm           A7              Dm
 No sign of love behind the tears
          A7
Cried for no one
Dm             A7                 Dm     Gsus4 G
  A love that should have lasted years
 
 
[VERSE]
C             C/B
 You want her, you need her
Am           C/G               Fmaj7              Bb
 And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
    C
You think she needs you

          A7
Cried for no one

[VERSE]
C              C/B
 You stay home, she goes out
Am             C/G          Fmaj7              Bb
 She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
    C
She doesn't need him
 
 
[VERSE]
C                C/B
 Your day breaks, your mind aches
Am             C/G                F                    Bb
 There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
C
You won't forget her
 
 
[CHORUS]
           Dm           A7
And in her eyes you see nothing
Dm           A7              Dm
 No sign of love behind the tears
          A7
Cried for no one
Dm             A7                 Dm     Gsus4 G
  A love that should have lasted years
