I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in and
Fm7                Fm6                 Fm7    Fm6  ( C G# F D# D )
stops my mind from wandering  where it will-- go
 
    F           C           F              C
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door and
Fm7               Fm6                Fm7     Fm6  ( C G# F D# D )
kept my mind from wandering where it will -- go                  And it
 
F              C             F         C                F
really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right, where I belong
          C         F
I'm right where I belong
C              G              C            G
See the people standing there who disagree and never win and
C               G               C
wonder why they don't get in my door 
 
    F            C         F        C
I'm painting the room in a colorful way and 
Fm7               Fm6                 Fm7    Fm6  ( C G# F D# D )
when my mind from wandering, where it will go                    And it
 
F              C             F         C                F
really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right, where I belong
          C         F
I'm right where I belong
C            G              C            G
Silly people run around who worry me and never ask me
C        G                 C
why they don't get past my door 
 
    F          C          F         C        Fm7
I'm taking the time for a number of things that weren't important 
Fm6             Fm7      Fm6  (C-G#-F-D#-D)
yesterday and I still   go
 
    F        C               F        C
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in and 
Fm7               Fm6            Fm7        Fm6  ( C G# F D# D )
stops my mind from wandering, where it will go
