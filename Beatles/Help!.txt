A                              C#m
   When I was younger, so much younger than today.
F#m                         D       G   A
   I never needed anybody's help in any way.
A                                   C#m
   But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured.
F#m                                      D      G      A

Bm                                     Bm7

   And now my life has changed in oh so many ways.
F#m                         D      G      A
   My independence seems to vanish in the haze.
A                           C#m
   But evâ€™ry now and then I feel so insecure.
F#m                                      D     G      A
   I know that I just need you like I've never done before.
