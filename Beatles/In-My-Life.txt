Intro:  A    E    A    E
 
          A      E      F#m    A7        D    Dm
There are places I'll remember,   all my life,
       A                                E       F#m   A7
Though some have changed. Some forever, not for better. 
          D    Dm     A
Some have gone,   and some remain.
 
          F#m7             D             G
All these places had their moments, with lovers and friends,
  A                          F#m7               B
I still can recall. Some are dead, and some are living.
   Dm            A              /              E
In my life, I've loved them all.
 
       A         E           F#m    A7          D    Dm
But of all these friends and lovers,   there is no - one,
   A                                  E          F#m   A7
Compares with you. And these memories lose their meaning,
       D        Dm      A
When I think of love as something new.
 
         F#m7                   D            G
Though I know I'll never lose affection, for people and things,
     A              F#m7                            B
That went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them.
   Dm         A
In my life, I love you more.
