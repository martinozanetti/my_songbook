Am                          Dm       C       F    C         E7
When I wake up early in the morning, lift my head I'm still yawning.
Am                          Dm     C       F   C       F
When I'm in the middle of a dream, stay in bed float upstream.
C                    Dm                Em               Dm
Please don't wake me no don't shake me leave me where I am
         Fmaj7
I'm only sleeping
 
Am                           Dm    C       F      C             E7
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy, I don't mind I think they're crazy
Am                           Dm     C        F    C          F
Running everywhere at such a speed 'til they find there's no need
C                     Dm             Em            Dm
Please don't spoil my day I'm miles away and after all
         Fmaj7    Am
I'm only sleeping
 
G7                    A7                Dm  Dm7
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window,
Gm
Taking my time
 
Am                             Dm       C       F     C      E7
Lying there and staring at the ceiling, waiting for a sleepy feeling 
 
C                     Dm             Em            Dm
Please don't spoil my day I'm miles away and after all
         Fmaj7   Am
I'm only sleeping
