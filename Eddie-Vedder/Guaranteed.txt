C  G
D  Dsus2 D Dsus4
 
[Verse 1]
G                    Bm
On bended knee is no way to be free
G7                         C/E
Lifting up an empty cup, I ask silently
C                         G
All my destinations will accept the one that's me
   D             Dsus2 D Dsus4
So I can breathe
 
[Verse 2]
G                           Bm
Circles they grow, and they swallow people whole
G7                                     C/E
Half their lives they say goodnight to wives they'll never know
  C                             G
A mind full of questions, and a teacher in my soul
    D          Dsus2 D Dsus4
And so it goes
 
[Verse 3]
G                    Bm
Don't come closer or I'll have to go
G7                          C/E
Holding me like gravity are places that pull
   C                         G
If ever there was someone to keep me at home
   D            Dsus2 D Dsus4
It would be you
 
[Verse 4]
G                          Bm
Everyone I come across, in cages they bought
     G7                                    C/E
They think of me and my wandering, but I'm never what they thought
     C                           G
I've got my indignation, but I'm pure in all my thoughts
D         Dsus2 D Dsus4
I'm alive
 
[Verse 5]
G                       Bm
Wind in my hair, I feel part of everywhere
G7                       C/E
Underneath my being is a road that disappeared
C                                       G
Late at night I hear the trees, they're singing with the dead
D        Dsus2 D Dsus4
Overhead
 
[Verse 6]
G                   Bm
Leave it to me as I find a way to be
   G7                      C/E
Consider me a satellite forever orbiting
C                             G
I knew all the rules, but the rules did not know me
D          Dsus2 D Dsus4
Guaranteed
