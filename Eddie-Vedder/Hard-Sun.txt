G5/D
D5     G5/D x4
 
[Verse 1]
D                         C
 When I walk beside her I am the better man
G                                  D
 When I look to leave her I always   stagger back again
D                                       C
 Once I built an ivory tower so I could   worship from above
      G                            D
When I climbed down to be set free   she took me in again
 
[Chorus]
          D             Am
There's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
 
[Verse 2]
D                                  C
 When she comes to greet me she is   mercy at my feet
G                                     D
 When I see her bitter charm she just   throws it back at me
D                             C
 Once I dug an early grave to find a better land
G                                               D
 She just smiled and laughed at me and took her blues back again
 
[Chorus]
          D             Am
There's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
              D             Am
Oh, there's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D     G5/D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
 
[Interlude]
D5     G5/D x2
 
[Verse 3]
D                                     C
 When I go to cross that river she is   comfort by my side
G                                  D                    G5/D
 When I try to understand she just   opens up her hands
 
[Instrumental]

D     G5/D C      G      D
 
[Chorus]
G5/D      D             Am
There's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D     G5/D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
 
[Interlude]
D5     G5/D x2
 
[Verse 4]
D                                C
 Once I stood to lose her when I   saw what I had done
G                                           D
 Bound down and threw away the hours of her   garden and her sun
D                          C
 So I tried to warn her, I turned to see her weep
G                               D
 40 days and 40 nights and it's still coming down on me
 
[Chorus]
          D             Am
There's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
              D             Am
Oh, there's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
 
              D             Am
Oh, there's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
              D             Am
Oh, there's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
 
          D             Am
There's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
              D             Am
Oh, there's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
 
          D             Am
There's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
          D             Am
There's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
 
          D             Am
There's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
