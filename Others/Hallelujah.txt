[Verse 1]
          G                 Em
Well I've heard there was a secret chord,
     G                   Em
That David played and it pleased the Lord,
    C                         D      G       D
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
   G                   C        D
It goes like this, the 4th, the 5th,
    Em                 C
The minor fall and the major lift,
    D               B7          Em
The baffled king composing hallelujah,
     C           Em          C           G   D    G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah

[Verse 2]
G                            Em
Your faith was strong but you needed proof,
     G                   Em
You saw her bathing on the roof,
    C                        D      G       D
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya,
    G                C          D
She tied you to her kitchen chair,
   Em                 C
She broke your throne and she cut your hair,
   D                B7          Em
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah,
     C           Em          C           G   D   G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah

[Verse 3]
  G                  Em
Baby, I've been here before,
    G                   Em
I know this room and I've walked this floor,
    C                         D      G       D
I used to live alone before I knew ya.
       G                   C        D
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch,
    Em                 C
And love is not a victory march,
      D               B7          Em
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah,
     C           Em          C           G   D   G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah

[Verse 4]
       G                 Em
There was a time when you let me know,
      G                   Em
What's really going on below,
    C                         D      G       D
But now you never show it to me do ya.
      G                   C        D
Well remember when I moved in you,
       Em                 C
And the holy dove was moving too,
    D               B7          Em
And every breath we drew was hallelujah,
     C           Em          C           G   D    G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah

[Verse 5]
G                Em
Maybe there's a God above,
     G                   Em
But all I ever learned from love,
    C                          D      G       D
Was how to shoot at somebody who outdrew ya.
         G                   C       D
And it's not a cry that you hear at night,
      Em                 C
It's not somebody who's seen the light,
       D               B7          Em
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah,
     C           Em          C           G   D
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-jah
     C           Em          C           G   D
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah
