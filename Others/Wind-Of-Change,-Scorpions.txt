 Listening to the wind of change

 An August summer night

 Soldiers passing by

 Listening to the wind of change

 Blowing with the wind of change

Where the children of tomorrow dream away

 Walking down the street

 Distant memories

 Are buried in the past forever
 
(C)              Dm
 I follow the Moskva

In the wind of change
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am                        G
 The wind of change blows straight
                  Am
Into the face of time
                           G
Like a stormwind that will ring
                              C
The freedom bell for peace of mind
                   Dm
Let your balalaika sing
                        E
What my guitar wants to say
