Mary, have you seen better days?
                                  G
And will you find different ways?
                             Dm                  C
And does he really mean that much to your heart?
G                                Am7               G
Carry, all of the weight you can, find another man
                      Dm                  C
And lead him directly there to the source
       Dm                      C
You've got to chart his course
 
             G
'Cause it is only in your heart
                Am7
This thing that makes you want to
 
Start it all again
Gmaj7            Am7
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
 
G                             Am7
Wake up from an elusive dream
                               G
You've got to change the scene
                        Dm             C
It's getting so hard to see to the end
G                                    Am7
Break down, all of the walls you can
                        G
You need a helping hand
                         Dm                 C
I'm sure there's someone there just for you
     Dm                     C
He's trying to make it, too
 
             G
'Cause it is only in your heart
                Am7
This thing that makes you want to
 
Start it all again
Gmaj7            Am7
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
 
G
Only in your heart
                Am7
This thing that makes you want to
                   Gmaj7
Start it all again
 
(La, la, la, la)

But life gets so hard when you reach the end
