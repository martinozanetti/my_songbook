[Verse 1]
 
        E                              G#m
Well, I tried to make it Sunday, but I got so damn depressed, 
       A                E            G#m
that I set my sights on Monday and I got myself undressed 
        A             F#m          C#m  G#m          A
I ain't ready for the altar, but I do  agree there's times, 
       F#m            A              E   Esus4 E
when a woman sure can be a friend of mine 
 
[Verse 2]
 
        E                                  G#m
Well, I keep on thinkin' 'bout you, Sister Golden Hair surprise, 
      A                   E                  G#m
and I just can't live without you; can't you see it in my eyes? 
       A             F#m                  C#m      G#m     A
I been one poor correspondent, and I been too, too hard to find, 
       F#m              A                E
but it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind 
 
[Chorus]
 
         B                               A              E
Will you meet me in the middle, will you meet me in the air? 
         B                            A                 E
Will you love me just a little, just enough to show you care? 
       F#m                 G#m                  A
Well I tried to fake it, I don't mind sayin', I just can't make it
