[Verse 1]
 
G           Em             Bm
This is for all the lonely people
G             Em                   Bm  D
Thinking that life has passed them by
C          D           G               Em
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
    C         D              G       D
And ride that highway in the sky
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G           Em             Bm
This is for all the single people
G             Em                 Bm  D
Thinking that love has left them dry
C          D           G               Em
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
    C     D              G
You never know until you try
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          C G/B Am
Well, I'm on my way
          C G/B Am
Yes, I'm back to stay
          C G/B Am  D    G      D
Well, I'm on my way back home

[Verse 3]
 
G           Em             Bm
This is for all the lonely people
G             Em                   Bm  D
Thinking that life has passed them by
C          D           G               Em
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
C            D               G      Em
She'll never take you down or never give you up
C            D              Em
You'll never know until you try
