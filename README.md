# My Songbook
Directory where I save txt files with chords and lyrics and a batch script to build a TOC, print and merge all together in a PDF booklet.

## Requirements

Songs will appear in the songbook grouped per autor and in alphabetic order. Autors will appear in alphabetic order, too. 

## Execute the script

Open a Command Prompt window.
Navigate to the directory where the batch script is saved.
Run the script with the PDF files you want to merge and the desired output file name:
