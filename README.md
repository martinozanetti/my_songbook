# My Songbook
Directory where I save txt files with chords and lyrics and a batch script to build a TOC, print and merge all together in a PDF booklet.

## Requirements

Windows OS <br>
Python (packages: `PyPDF2, fpdf`)

## Folder organization

```
Autor1
    Song1
    Song2
    Song3
Autor2
    Song1
    Song2
    Song3
Autor3
    Song1
    Song2
    Song3
```

Songs will appear in the songbook grouped per autor and in alphabetic order. Autors will appear in alphabetic order, too. 

## Execute the script

Open a Command Prompt window.
Navigate to the directory where the batch script is saved.
Run the script:

```create_songbook.bat```
