[Verse 1]
G       G6       G      G6
  It's another tequila sunrise
D                            Am
  Starin' slowly 'cross the sky
D7         G  G6  G  G6
  Said goodbye
G  G6            G      G6
   He was just a hired hand
D                                      Am
  Workin' on the dreams he planned to try
D7             G  G6  G  G6
  The days go by
 
[Chorus]
Em                      C
   Every night when the sun goes down
Em              C
   Just another lonely boy in town
Em     Am                 D7
   and she's out runnin' round
 
[Verse 2]
G     G6           G       G6
  She wasn't just another woman
D                                  Am
  And I couldn't keep from comin' on
D7              G  G6  G  G6
  It's been so long
G  G6            G       G6
  Oh, and it's a hollow feelin'
D                               Am
  When it comes down to dealin' friends
D7          G  G6  G  G6
  It never ends

[Bridge]
Am              D
   Take another shot of courage
Bm                E                 Am   B7
   Wonder why the right words never co - ome
             Em7    A7
You just get numb
 
[Verse 3]
G       G6       G      G6
  It's another tequila sunrise
D                                 Am
  This old world still looks the same
D7          G  G6  G  G6
  Another frame
