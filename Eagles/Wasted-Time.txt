[Verse]
C                    Fm6
Well baby, there you stand
C/G                                 F/G
With your little head, down in your hand
F               C/E                Dm        C/E
Oh, my God, you can't believe it's happening again
F                            C/E
Your baby's gone, and you're all alone
       Dm             G7
And it looks like the end.
 
C                          Fm6
And you're back out on the street,
C/E                  F/G    G7
And you're tryin' to remember.
F                   C/E
How do you start it over?
   Dm                 C/E
You don't know if you can.
    F                      C/E
You don't care much for a stranger's touch,
        Dm              Gsus4  G7
But you can't hold your man.
 
[Chorus]
Am                      E7/G#
You never thought you'd be alone
G                 D7/F#
This far down the line
F                              Em
And I know what's been on your mind
       Dm                   G7     C
You're afraid it's all been wasted time.
 
[Bridge]
Bm7        E                   Am
The autumn leaves have got you thinking
Bm7       E                   Am
About the first time that you fell
Bm7         E           Am       C/G
You didn't love the boy too much, no, no
         F     Em          Dm    G7
You just loved the boy too well, farewell.
 
[Verse]
C                       Fm6
So you live from day to day,
C/G                   F/G      G7
And you dream about tomorrow, oh,
        F                C/E
And the hours go by like minutes
        Dm              C/E
And the shadows come to stay
       F                 C/E
So you take a little something 
   Dm            Gsus4  G7
To make them go away.
 
[Chorus]
Am                       E7/G#
And I could have done so many things, baby
   G                    D7/F#
If I could only stop my mind
     F                      Em
From wondrin' what I left behind
         Dm                  G7     C
And from worrying 'bout this wasted time.
Ab                             C
Ooh, another love has come and gone
Ab                              C    C  Dm  C/E
Ooh, and the years keep rushing on
    F               C/E
I remember what you told 
     Dm                        C/E
me before you went out on your own:
              F            C/E
"Sometimes to keep it together,
          Dm        G7
You gotta leave it alone."
   Am                       E7/G#
So you can get on with your search, baby,
    G                 D7/F#
And I can get on with mine
    F                     Em
And maybe someday we will find, that it
Dm             G7    C
Wasn't really wasted time.
Ab     Bb  C
Oh ooooh,
Ab     Bb  C
Oh ooooh,
Ab     Fm  C
Oh ooooh.
