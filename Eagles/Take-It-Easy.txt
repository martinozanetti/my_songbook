        Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load,
                     D     C
I've got seven women on my mind.
G                       D
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me,
 C                         G
one says she's a friend of mine. 
        Em            C    G
Take it easy, take it ea - sy, 
              Am                C                Em
don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy. 
        C                   G              C            G
Lighten up while you still can, don't even try to under-stand, 
            Am                 C                 G
just find a place to make your stand and take it easy. 
            G
Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona 
                D        C
and such a fine sight to see: 
       G                   D
it's a girl, my Lord, in a flat bed Ford 
        C                      G
slowin' down to take a look at me. 
         Em   D             C     G
Come on, ba - by, don't say may - be. 
        Am                 C             Em
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me. 
       C               G                  C               G
We may lose and we may win though we will never be here a-gain. 
        Am               C              G
So open up, I'm climbin' in, so take it easy.
