[Verse]
 
C                            F
All alone at the end of the evening
          C                          F
And the bright lights have faded to blue
        C               E7                   Am
I was thinkin' 'bout a woman who might have loved me
             G
And I never knew
                              C                    F
You know I've always been a dreamer Spent my life running round
                      C                   F
And it's so hard to change Can't seem to settle down
                          Dm     F
But the dreams I've seen lately
                     Fadd9          G               F     G
Keep turnin' out and burnin' out & turnin' out the same
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    F           C         F         C
So put me on a highway & show me a sign
     F              G              C    C  F  C  G  F
And take it to the limit one more time
 
 
[Verse]
 
          C                         F
You can spend all your time making money
          C                         F
You can spend all your love making time
      C            E7        Am                       G
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow would you still be mine
                                   C             F
And when you're looking for your freedom nobody seems to care
                        C                  F
And you can't find the door, can't find it anywhere
                           Dm       F
When there's nothin' to believe in
                                 Fadd9                  G                F   G
Still you're commin' back, you're runnin' back, you're commin' back for more
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    F            C         F        C
So put me on a highway & show me a sign
     F              G              Am       G
And take it to the limit one more time
 
 
[Ending]
 
F                G      F              G
Take it to the limit,  take it to the limit
F               G              C
Take it to the limit one more time
         F              G          F               G
You can take it to the limit, yes take it to the limit 
          C
One more time.
