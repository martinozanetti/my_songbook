Desperado,  why don't you come to your senses
            G          Em
You've been out ridin' fences,
    A7        D7
for so long - now.
            G        G7
Oh you're a hard one.
            C               Cm
I know that you've got your reasons.
      G               Em
These things that are pleasin' you
    A7       D7  G   D
Can hurt you somehow.
 
          Em                Bm
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
       C                 G
She'll beat you if she's able.
             Em                 C                G   D
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.
       Em                Bm
Now it seems to me, some fine things
          C              G
Have been laid upon your table.
        Em            A7
But you only want the ones
               Am  D
That you can't get.
 
     G
Desperado,
G7               C          Cm
 Ohhhh you ain't getting no younger.
     G             Em
Your pain and your hunger,
        A7          D7
They're driving you home.
    G           G7
And freedom, oh freedom.
                 C           Cm
Well that's just some people talking.
     G         Em                   A7    D7   G    D
Your prison is walking through this world all alone.
 
           Em                   Bm
Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
    C                      G
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine.
     Em               C                   G   D
It's hard to tell the night time from the day.
           Em              Bm
And you're losing all your highs and lows
         C             G

 Am  D   D7

     G
Desperado,

 Why don't you come to your senses?
     G              Em      A7       D7
come down from your fences, open the gate.
          G      G7              C        Cm
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you.
           G            Em
You better let somebody love you.
 C            Am
(let somebody love you)
           G       B7   Em
You better let somebody love you...ohhh..hooo
  Am        D7          G
